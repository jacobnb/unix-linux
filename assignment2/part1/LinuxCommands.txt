** find / \( -type f -o -type d \) -perm -02 -ls **
find / = find all files starting current location
-type f = of type file
-o = or
-type d = type directory
-perm = files permission bits are set 
-02 = write
-ls = list current file in ls -dils format on standard output


/tmp is safe b/c sticky bit set on it. (only owner or root may remove the file)
and because the owner (or root) can set the permissions on any file they create.


** SUID / SGID **
Find all suid and sgid programs
find / -perm /6000

This command works, but there is a lot of noise. To remove some of it, redirect the error stream into the out stream and use grep -v to filter out lines with Permission Denied.
find / -perm /6000 2>&1 -ls | grep -v "Permission denied" 

** SUID / SGID owned by root:root **
